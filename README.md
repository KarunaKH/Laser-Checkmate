# Laser-Checkmate
Laser Checkmate is an adversarial board game in which two players take turns to place laser emitters in a square grid, to cover maximum blocks in their laser's range.

GOAL: Its Simple! The blocks in your range,the more points you get, YOU WIN!

RULES:
1. Each laser's beam penetrates in each direction, UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT,and All four diagonals.
2. The range of the Lasers get blocked by walls(edges of the grid) and Towers(occupying random place in the grid).
3. You can place lasers only in empty blocks(and not even on the blocks that are in some other laser's range).
4. Although, your laser's range can intersect with other laser's range.
5. The game terminates when there are no valid moves left.

POINTS: You get 1 point for each laser's beam. 2 points for where you place the laser.

VALID MOVE: A player places the laser in the block that contains no laser emitter, wall or tower and that is not covered by any laser(from either player)

TRICK: The laser has range of upto 3 blocks only!
